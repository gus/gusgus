# Things I have learned about myself

### I need to own something before I can act on it

However, at that point, I don't know that that's what I'm doing. It has become implicit knowledge; a priori

### I have to write something down before I can get to my true thoughts and feelings

### I am a uniter

### I like a certain level of stress in my life

Extremely low - and I'll do whatever I can to keep it that way

### I compromise to a fault

### I respect the judgement of my elders

Perhaps also to a fault

### I'm a procrastinator

But I'm getting better

### I don't mind a chaotic desk

### I'm not a list person

### I'm an artist

### I do unto others ... I hope

### I do want anyone or anything to suffer

Ever

I also carry an extreme amount of guilt for being white, male, and human. Enough said.
