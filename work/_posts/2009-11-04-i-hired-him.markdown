So, do you remember when I [talked about my friend](/code/affirmation-of-a-programmer.html) [Kurt](http://my-unemployment-challenge.blogspot.com/) who came in to play programmer for a day? Well, I was so impressed with his skills, I figured "Why not hire him on part-time to do our QA at [CareRunner](http://carerunner.com)?" Because I've never mentioned it, I'm leading the technology department for CareRunner, which is a small start-up. Anyways, it's been two weeks, he has no idea what QA exactly is yet, but he's doing a great job of finding the superficial problems we developers are no good at. He's already learning how unrelated actions in performed in tandem can create unexpected results. His keen eye doubles as a typo magnet as well.

I've also tasked him with understanding what QA is, learning advanced testing techniques, and how he can go about automating his job. Selenium being the first obvious choice for automation. I'm really interested to see how well his music background helps in this area; specifically, that of composing a symphony of tests and suites. Finding patterns and what not. He's also pretty aggravated that he can't find any good educational material yet, which is great. Necessity is the mother of invention.
