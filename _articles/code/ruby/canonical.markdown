# Canonical: Rails ActionMailer extension for substituting inline email addresses

<cite>November 8th, 2008</cite>

[excerpt]
I and a co-worker (Eric Schwartz) wrote [Canonical](http://github.com/centro/canonical/tree/master) for [Centro](http://centro.net) -  my current employer. Canonical does for your Rails app what Postfix's [canonical](http://www.postfix.org/canonical.5.html) would do for your sys-admin. But now, you have the control! Ha ha!

Alright fine, Canonical is an ActionMailer extension that acts just like the Postfix utility of the same name. Essentially, Canonical lets you substitute the To, CC, and/or BCC email destinations with one of many replacements via a rule. It can be great for your integration and testing environments to direct all mail so that it is sent to a QA email address or something.

You may add a canonical rule like the following to send any email from the system to any address to the QA email distribution list:

    TMail::Mail.add_canonical_override(/.*/, 'qa@foo.bar')

Assuming you are working at Foo Bar, that rule will match any destination address that has any character in it - meaning, it matches everything - and will substitute the matched email with qa@foo.bar. This is the same as saying the following in Postfixâ€™s canonical file:

    /.*/, qa@foo.bar

What you should notice is that canonical expects to see a regular expression as the first argument. Passing in anything that does not respond to =~ will result in an error.

Have fun!
