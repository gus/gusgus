# Come on, now!

If you're in or around the Ruby and/or Rails communities, probably you've heard about the debacle regarding [sexually explicit images in a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-porn-star?src=embed) from Matt Aiemonetti. If not, take a moment and flip through the slides. The content is irrelevant, as Matt so made so blatantly obvious. That presentation was hard to flip through. Each and every slide made me think:

* Oh jesus, what's on the next slide?
* Where are the male porn stars ... and ... why are there so many women?
* Why aren't there any pictures of men trying to please a women or women?
* Why would I want to be a porn star?
* Could this guy be any more of a misogynist?
* How does all of this relate to using CouchDB? Seriously!

There are many responses with a wide array of stances. But, I haven't found a complete picture from anyone suggesting why this affair is just bad. That's not to say there weren't any statements or opinions I did like. I did, for intance, like something Sarah Mei had to say in [_why's](http://hackety.org/) [response](http://hackety.org/2009/04/29/aSelectionOfThoughtsFromActualWomen.html):

    [...] I’m a minority in this community. I know that, and generally I can ignore it and go along thinking it’s a meritocracy of ideas and code. Then I encounter a woman’s thonged rear on the screen at a conference, 20 feet tall, and I remember, oh yeah, people like me don’t belong here. To most of these men around me, I am, at best, an oddity, and at worst, a sexual target. I feel a little less safe.

I'll state my opinion here and now: **it's fucking shameful**. It's shameful to me for the following reasons:

* I have a wife
* I have a son
* I have friends
* I'm a white, male programmer

Hopefully, I'll be able to suggest in this article why many ought to be ashamed and why this IS just bad (NEED SOMETHING BETTER HERE).

### I'm a white, male programmer

This means I have [white](http://www.unh.edu/residential-life/diversity/aw_article17.pdf), [male](http://malalatete.typepad.com/mal_a_la_tete/2007/10/white-male-priv.html) [privilege](http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/whiteprivilege.htm). I accept that white, male privilege exists and I'm not proud of it, but that doesn't fucking matter. I can't say "I never asked for it" any more than a black man can say "I never asked to be black". It is as it is and we do as we should.

And to top being white and male, I am a member of a professional community that has been dominated by white males for a VERY LONG period of time.
