# Be Less Specific

[excerpt]
Here are some phrases that popped into my head lately, which I think should not be applied in their literalness:

* "Now put your hands together for someone who needs NO introduction"
* "I can drink you under the table" ... I'd rather you not drink me at all.
* "Follow your heart"
* "Eat your heart out, so-and-so"
* "We need you to wear several hats ..."
* "Give yourself to the cause"
* ""

You should also avoid sites like [Real Simple](http://realsimple.com) just because they have articles like [18 Common Phrases to Avoid in Conversation](http://www.realsimple.com/work-life/etiquette/sticky-situations/common-phrases-avoid-conversation-10000001698308/). If you don't know to avoid these phrases, well ... let's just say ... nah, forget it!
