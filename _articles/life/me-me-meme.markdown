I was running around on the Internets just now and ran into [Matt Darby's](http://blog.matt-darby.com/) [The Me Meme](http://blog.matt-darby.com/2008/10/04/the-me-meme/) post. Alright, I'll do it.

---

Pay it forward instructions:

1. Take a picture of yourself right now
2. Don’t change your clothes, don’t fix your hair…just take a picture. (should be super-easy with Photobooth)
3. Post that picture with NO editing
4. Post these instructions with your picture
