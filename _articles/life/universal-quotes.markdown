# Universal Quotes - Going Way Back

<cite>September 11th, 2008</cite>

[excerpt]
Man, the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org) is awesome and scary all at the same time. It's awesome that one can build a true history of progress of the web and it's design. It's scary to find old stuff you've actually caused. For instance, I found my [home page](http://web.archive.org/web/19970731032532/www.iit.edu/~knowjus/) from when I was in college at [IIT](http://www.iit.edu).

I hadn't seen that page in a loooooonnngggg time and it was definitely a blast from the past. One good thing did come out of it, though - besides being glad we no longer have to use the `FONT` HTML tag (thank you CSS) - I found my page of universal quotes that I had kept track of while in college.
