  Blurp! The following are just random thoughts, phrases, works, whatever that just pop into my head and I
  don't want to lose or bother my twittr pals with. See how nice I am?
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Happiness is something you are, not something you obtain</li>
  <li>If I could do one thing and I could do it well, it would be paper machet</li>
  <li>I'll give <strong>you</strong> a jack in the box</li>
  <li>Well ... your mom understands</li>
</ul>
