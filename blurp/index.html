  don't want to lose or bother my twittr pals with. See how nice I am?

<ul>
  <li>Grizly Gus guzzles gallons of coffee</li>
  <li>It feels like a newspaper without the newspaper feel</li>
  <li>I suppose you could see the future. If you envisioned what you wanted, only concerned yourself with that, and didn't give a shit about anything else.</li>
  <li>I'm all blogged up!</li>
  <li>Reduce the domain of complexity in order to solve problems efficiently</li>
  <li>Is the kwisatz haderach of one present universe also the simultaneous kwisatz haderach in another universe? These questions need answering.</li>
  <li><a href="http://gist.github.com/">gist</a> me gently, one time ... one time</li>
  <li>I'm a volcano of comedy and you're in the ring of humor</li>
  <li>Gods are always furious. Ex: see the Old Testament.</li>
  <li>Grand to gross can be done in one step. Gross to grand is somewhat more like moving glaciers.</li>
  <li>There are two modes in my brain: reality and chat. In chat mode, I'm a phonetic typist making me a horrible grammarist.</li>
  <li>Maybe it has its paradigm rooted in another dimension</li>
  <li>&lt;NAME&gt;, that's a cute one. You must have had flowers and god nectar for breakfast this morning!</li>
  <li>Happiness is something you are, not something you obtain</li>
  <li>If I could do one thing and I could do it well, it would be paper machet</li>
  <li>I'll give <strong>you</strong> a jack in the box</li>
  <li>Well ... your mom understands</li>
</ul>
