Hey! Here's another in the series of random thoughts ...

You can't spell **[Waterfall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)** without these words :)

* ew
* fatal
* real flaw
* fear wall
* fear [Walt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney) - *It's a damned mickey-mouse methodology*
* we fall
* all wet
* late war
* [faal](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/faal) - *Languages are tools, not boundaries*
* [fae](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fey) law
* a tall few
* wart ale
* flea trawl
* fat aw
* [Lar](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lar) tale
* a lew fart
* wall art
* a flare
* [rale](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rale)
* later
* [lawfare](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lawfare) - *you can make it mean something*
* after wall - *it's just an anagram*

Other points of note are that some of the words that can be made from "waterfall" relate to authority in some language or another, for instance: Lar, frea, and walt.
