summary: A new (as of this writing) daily news blog for JavaScript stuff

A few days ago [Alex Young](http://alexyoung.org/) and [Ric "Swirrly" Roberts](http://www.ricroberts.com/) started a news blog called [Daily JS](http://dailyjs.com/) (aka Daily JavaScript). As you can imagine, it's news and stuff about ... JavaScript. Terrificly enough, they invited me to contribute (probably because I update *THIS* blog so often ;) Anyways, I will-be/have-been contributing it and you should-be/will-be reading it. Right?

We already have quite a few thoughts in the queue about interesting things we want to post about; so long as we can make it fit into 3 paragraphs; of which Alex has broken his own rules at least two times.

I actually think grabbing the Daily\*.com series of domains was a stroke of genius. It's so simple, yet I never even thought about it. Well ... now I've thought about it and I think it would be great if someone (read: me) started a [DailyQA.com](http://dailyqa.com). I have the [perfect candidate](/work/i-hired-him.html) in mind to do the contributing ;)
