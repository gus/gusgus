title: You know what?
summary: Things I haven't heard Ruby programmers say
---

I just read [Avdi Grimm's](http://devblog.avdi.org/about/) [Your Code is my Hell](http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/08/22/your-code-is-my-hell/). It's also been my personal "pleasure" to see Rails projects get out of hand very fast. And to see future teams push out code much slower than their greenfield counterparts. I'm to blame in some/most of those instances; sadly. But, I've never heard any teammate I've worked on a Rails/Ruby app with say any of the following things originally listed in the afore-mentioned article:

* “Design Patterns are a Java thing. In Ruby you just write code.”
* “The warnings Ruby produces are dumb; just disable them.”
* “Sure they aren’t technically Unit Tests, but isolating objects turned out to be kind of hard and besides nobody else is doing it.”
* “Monkeypatching is frowned on in other languages, but in Ruby it’s fine. The downsides almost never materialize.”
* “Stuff like the Law of Demeter isn’t really as important in Ruby code”
* “Dividing methods into private and public is for control freaks, you don’t need it in Ruby”
* “That’s only a code smell when it’s in Java code”
* “That’s only a problem in large projects” (implying that this project will never become large).

In all honesty, I've heard some of these things mentioned in reference to Java projects I have worked on in the past.

I feel bad for Avdi. He should find some better people to work with.
