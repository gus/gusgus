I've been thinking this little thought for a long, long time. Probably as long as I've known my wife. Actually, I believe it is that long, but she'll have to confirm because she has proclaimed her memory to be of mightier ilk than mine. So this thought is *"Wouldn't it be fun to start a cover band who's songs are all twisted to sound narcisstic?"*

The answer is, *"Yes, it would be tons of fun!"*

And the name of this band? **Narcissus**

What songs would we sing? Here's a spontaneous list I've been working on for a while:

1. [I am the Wind Beneath Your Wings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiS8YokFzeY) - *Bette Midler* (I think)
1. [If You Could Build Your Whole World Around Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK4pl_frlPg) - *Marvin Gaye*
1. [I'm Even Better than the Real Thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrch66gdjjk) - *U2* - This reminds me of when I was 16, just got my license, it's December but really sunny and no snow, and I'm driving past golden fields of unharvested corn stalks in rural Ohio. Perhaps one of my all time favorite songs. For real. I get tingles.
1. [Nothing Compares 2 Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUiTQvT0W_0) - *Sinead O'Connor* - Love the haircut. If it wasn't for space monkeys in Fight Club, I'd have to say she was my inspiration for choosing a hairstyle.
1. [You Miss Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzYlj41YVzA) - *Bj√∂rk*
1. [I'm So Vain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omWQzYycyJk) - *Carly Simon* - Probably not what you expected :) BAM! It's like one of those pop-in-and-ruin-your-photo-persons but in the form of a video.
1. [All For Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MMcLEdkY68) - *Sister Hazel*
1. [I Touch Myself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTneO6UgRuM) - *The Divinyls* - What a perfect song; no changes necessary. Well ... that's not true. *"When I think about me I ..."*

8 songs should be enough for a demo I think. 8 also seems to come up a lot in my life, even though 7 is my favorite number and 12:34 shows up on the clock a lot - or I notice it a lot - and the sum of 12:34 is 1 (10 then 1 + 0).

Maaaayyybe - and this is just a maybe - my lucky number is 187. Thoughts?
