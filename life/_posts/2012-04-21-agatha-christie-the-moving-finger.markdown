You've probably seen [adactio's article about AudioGO and the DMCA](http://adactio.com/journal/5405/). It's an interesting thing to behold copyright fiasco. I don't really have much to say (at this moment) on the subject, but ... I love the [Agatha Christie - The Moving Finger](http://dc436.4shared.com/img/892695085/b3c907d3/dlink__2Fdownload_2FaKhc8m9b_3Ftsid_3D20120318-72646-b4a59ab0/preview.mp3) book so much I just want to NOT share it so much with you via that link to a preview that does NOT exist.
