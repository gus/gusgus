title: "I Voted!"
summary: I did it again
---

I voted! Yes I did. Got up at 5:45a because my wife was tossing and turning all night for some reason. Got to the same voting center I had voted at for 2 previous elections at around 6:15a. At neither of the previous two elections did I encounter a line. Not true of the 2008 election. 45 minute wait.

Awesome!
