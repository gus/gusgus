title: Extended Tetris
summary: Taking pieces beyond x and y shifts
---
[First person tetris](http://firstpersontetris.com/), what a trip (thanks [Assaf](http://twitter.com/assaf)). I'm glad I do not have to rotate my world around in order to put something on a shelf. Playing it got me thinking, though. The thought was, *"What would the pieces look like if the individual blocks were not forced to meet along their edges?"* As in, what if the blocks could meet at their corners.

Whelp, here's how. I might be missing a few, but whatever. That would be one hell of game.
