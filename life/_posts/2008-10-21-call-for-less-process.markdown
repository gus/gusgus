title: A Call for Less Process
summary: Ranting - can't we all just get along

I happened to be reading the Metra's [Bi-level](http://metrarail.com/OTBL/current.pdf) monthly newsletter the other day and noticed an odd post in the Sound Off section. Entitled, "Take the high road?"; the author (an impassioned rider) was venting about the fairness of the daily merging and exit strategy between the upper and lower levels of the bi-level train cars.

I'll let Jeffrey explain his problem:

> I personally have a problem with how people are too courteous to others while getting off the trains. You see, the upper level passengers, though there are fewer of them compared to the ground level, always get to merge while exiting at a one-to-one ratio with all the passengers on the main floor (sometimes even two-to-one since one person from each side of the upper level gets to go!).  That then leads to the whole upper level clearing out before even the first three to four rows of passengers on the ground level getting off –it's pretty unfair if you ask me! I mean, so if you're in the last two to three rows of that cabin –forget it, you might as well sit down, have breakfast, read War and Peace if you're trying to get off quick –all the while you see the smirking faces of the upper level passengers as they get off without delay. I propose a four-to-one ratio be unofficially implemented, where the upper level passengers should wait before coming down and merging with all the other traffic.  This would only be fair.  Otherwise, I'm going to start practicing my climbing skills to get myself up there so I can get off the train sooner!

What struck me most is that Jeffrey's answer to the problem was to ask the seeming authority for more process. Though he's the one with the problem, he wants the solution to be solved for him instead of him adjusting to the situation or solving the situation himself.

This is an all too often seen habit of people in moderate-or-larger sized organizations. "Fix it for me" is a creature of complacency and when it rears its head, you **need** to take notice.

Jeffrey, perhaps you could take a different train or you could move to the front of the car if it bothers you so much. Personally, I have adjusted by actually sitting on the top as I noticed I got off much faster this way. You may also want to notice that the top level holds less than half the number of people that the bottom level does; so, it may actually be fair after all.

Change your perspective or change your life.
