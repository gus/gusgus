Hey! Have you ever gone to the book store and - I don't know - stopped in the self-help section?

No? Oh. Yeah, me either.

But let's say you did. Just for shits and giggles you do it. What do you think you would see?

*"Self-help books."*

Yep.

Now; have you ever analyzed these titles?

Oh yeah, that's tons of fun. It's a friggin' riot! When they say self-help section, they don't mean the stuff IN the books; they mean the stuff ON the books. There are some real winners out there.

A nice recurse down the [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com) slide proves this point:

1. [Not Again...Please Come Home: You're not alone! A comforting guide for women who choose to love, and be with, the man who frequently forgets his way home. ... with it and feel more peace in your heart.](http://www.amazon.com/Not-Again-Please-Come-Home-comforting/dp/0595189709/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217309150&sr=1-6)
2. [1200 Pick Up Lines](http://www.amazon.com/1200-Pick-Lines-Zahid-Zaman/dp/1419670875/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217309573&sr=1-4)
3. [Being the Strong Man a Woman Wants: Timeless Wisdom on Being a Man](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Strong-Man-Woman-Wants/dp/0973695102/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b)
4. [The Book of Mormon Made Easier, Part II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555177611/ref=cap_pdp_dp_3)
5. [Just Who Will You Be?: Big Question. Little Book. Answer Within.](http://www.amazon.com/Just-Who-Will-You-Question/dp/1401323189/ref=sr_1_30?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1217309979&sr=1-30)

Sure. Those are pretty funny. No no, they are funny. Really. *Mormon. Easier. Part 2.* Seriously?!

Did you happen to click on any of the links. Did you notice a little trick Amazon uses called *Better Together*. This is where they put two books together and suggest that they complement each other ... and anyways - other people have bought them together; shouldn't you?

That in mind - and remembering that I asked about actually being in the bookstore - just notice how I noticed the truly self-medicating effect the self-help section was when I was at [Borders](http://www.yelp.com/biz/borders-books-music-and-cafe-chicago-6) just the other day (pictures below). Mind you, I didn't have Amazon's *Better Together* in mind at the time - I discovered that while writing this post - when I decided to take a few pictures of some book titles that seemed to, well, tell a story when put together.

### Threesomes. It's all in your head.

This was the one that kicked it all off. I was standing there with my [wife](http://lesfeministes.com) and pointed it out. She laughed and I friggin' **KNEW** I was on to something.

### Stop whining. I love you.

That's a lesson one only learns after getting married.

* *"Babe, why aren't you listening to me?"*
* *"Babe, why did you throw my phone out the car window?"*
* *"Babe, don't make me change my vertically striped dress shirt and plaid shorts. They match, damn it. It's my life!"*
* *"Babe, whose boxers are these?"* :O

Anyways ... if you stop whining, you'll actually see the love.

### What happy women know. How to duck a suckah.

Nuf said!

### Hold on to your NUTs. A thousand names for Joy.

The wife also laughed at this one. Oh yeah!

### The Answer. Only a theory.

I knew it! I've been saying that for years. I told my 5th grade teacher the same damn thing about the math test.

## Moving on

If you haven't figured it out, this was fun for me. I want to add more pictures and with a longer chaining of titles. We're talking 3 or more books to create a real story of these titles.
