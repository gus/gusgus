title: "PSA: Renewing Illinois Registration without Renewal Notice"
summary: A note to Illinois drivers
---

You live in Illinois?

You need to get a new sticker for that license plate of yours (even though you also pay for the metal it's attached to)?

You lost your renewal notice that they sent you in the email or you just plain never received it (yeah right)?

No problem. Just head over to your local [DMV](http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/departments/drivers/facilities/home.html) with a drivers license (preferably yours) and something that shows your license plate number - such as last year's registration slip.

Oh yeah, and bring a 100 friggin' dollars to renew your privilege to drive unencumbered by the state, in the state.
