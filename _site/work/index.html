    <p>So, do you remember when I <a href='/code/affirmation-of-a-programmer.html'>talked about my friend</a> <a href='http://my-unemployment-challenge.blogspot.com/'>Kurt</a> who came in to play programmer for a day? Well, I was so impressed with his skills, I figured &#8220;Why not hire him on part-time to do our QA at <a href='http://carerunner.com'>CareRunner</a>?&#8221; Because I&#8217;ve never mentioned it, I&#8217;m leading the technology department for CareRunner, which is a small start-up. Anyways, it&#8217;s been two weeks, he has no idea what QA exactly is yet, but he&#8217;s doing a great job of finding the superficial problems we developers are no good at. He&#8217;s already learning how unrelated actions in performed in tandem can create unexpected results. His keen eye doubles as a typo magnet as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also tasked him with understanding what QA is, learning advanced testing techniques, and how he can go about automating his job. Selenium being the first obvious choice for automation. I&#8217;m really interested to see how well his music background helps in this area; specifically, that of composing a symphony of tests and suites. Finding patterns and what not. He&#8217;s also pretty aggravated that he can&#8217;t find any good educational material yet, which is great. Necessity is the mother of invention.</p>
