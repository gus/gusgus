    <div class="content"><p>My current place of residence is a townhouse. This implies we&#8217;re attached to other people but should also imply that we&#8217;re surrounded by like-living individuals; as in, there are other townhouse complexes around me. The arrangement of this particular townhouse neighborhood is such that our buildings are ass-to-ass, separated by a common driveway; the same goes in the front except that we are separated by some grass and a sidewalk.</p>
<img src='/images/articles/life/townhome-sketch.jpg' height='447px' alt='A sketch of the townhome makeup' width='460px' />
<p>Something really special about this neighborhood are my immediate, but divided neighbors. I say special because they truly are a special breed of person &#8230; Let&#8217;s take a for instance,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BLAH BLAH BLAH AAAAAGGGGGHHHH. I&#8217;M A LITTLE KID AND I LIKE TO YELL A LOT!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or something very similar to that was being yelled by the two little child gremlins. I&#8217;m pretty certain they have some sort of brain parasite that is pressing really friggin&#8217; hard on the loud wrinkle of their brain. Or maybe not.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</em> Because this is what I heard next,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>STOP FUCKING YELLING!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&#8220;Who said that?&#8221;</em> Dad did. Really classy, Dad.</p>

<p>So, to stop the children from yelling he decided yelling at them was the appropriate action. A double negative; one yell negates another, thus eliminating any yell from the cosmic sound recorder &#8230; with a buffered delay.</p>

<p>But wait, what you don&#8217;t know is where Dad was in relation to the kids. The kids were in their driveway just behind their house. Dad was a knight&#8217;s move away in a neighbor&#8217;s driveway.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;What was he doing there?&#8221;</em> Partying with the neighbors.</p>

<p><em>What were they doing?</em> Drinking, playing bags, watching the Stanley Cup, and &#8230; oh yeah &#8230; yelling a whole fucking lot.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a dad, so I&#8217;ll admit a couple of things. One, kids have an innate ability to make brain piercing sounds &#8230; and then laugh about it because they know it&#8217;s annoying and loud, but I guess that&#8217;s what&#8217;s funny to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HA HA HA HA! I&#8217;M A KID! LISTEN TO THIS REALLY FUNNY, EAR BONE CRUNCHING SOUND I CAN MAKE WITH THIS STICK AND THIS PAN AND THIS CONCRETE DRIVEWAY! WHAM WHAM WHAM! AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH IT&#8217;S SO FUNNY!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you&#8217;re blood pressure is already up, then any sound might blow your top. Two, being a hypocrite is part of being human. You make mistakes and then teach your children not to be as stupid as you. But, teaching your kids not to make a mistake by showing them how bad their mistake was with their own mistake &#8230; big fail. And this, in my opinion, is the American Hypocrisy.</p>

<p>We do this everywhere. In school, in government, in religion (if you ask me, and I don&#8217;t give a shit because I&#8217;m a Knowldenist), in diplomacy. I don&#8217;t just mean the blatant hypocrisy of building and maintaining nuclear weapons, but something more low-level than that. As a nation, we do unto others as we want to do; then we put one finger in each ear and declare <em>&#8220;La la la la la la la la!&#8221;</em> And if you have the right amount of power, there&#8217;s no reason you need to pull your fingers out of your ears and scrape the wax off.</p></div>
