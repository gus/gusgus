<p>Hey! Have you ever gone to the book store and - I don&#8217;t know - stopped in the self-help section?</p>

<p>No? Oh. Yeah, me either.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s say you did. Just for shits and giggles you do it. What do you think you would see?</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Self-help books.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Yep.</p>

<p>Now; have you ever analyzed these titles?</p>

<p>Oh yeah, that&#8217;s tons of fun. It&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; riot! When they say self-help section, they don&#8217;t mean the stuff IN the books; they mean the stuff ON the books. There are some real winners out there.</p>

<p>A nice recurse down the <a href='http://www.amazon.com'>Amazon</a> slide proves this point:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Not-Again-Please-Come-Home-comforting/dp/0595189709/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217309150&amp;sr=1-6'>Not Again&#8230;Please Come Home: You&#8217;re not alone! A comforting guide for women who choose to love, and be with, the man who frequently forgets his way home. &#8230; with it and feel more peace in your heart.</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/1200-Pick-Lines-Zahid-Zaman/dp/1419670875/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217309573&amp;sr=1-4'>1200 Pick Up Lines</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Being-Strong-Man-Woman-Wants/dp/0973695102/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b'>Being the Strong Man a Woman Wants: Timeless Wisdom on Being a Man</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555177611/ref=cap_pdp_dp_3'>The Book of Mormon Made Easier, Part II</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.amazon.com/Just-Who-Will-You-Question/dp/1401323189/ref=sr_1_30?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217309979&amp;sr=1-30'>Just Who Will You Be?: Big Question. Little Book. Answer Within.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Sure. Those are pretty funny. No no, they are funny. Really. <em>Mormon. Easier. Part 2.</em> Seriously?!</p>

<p>Did you happen to click on any of the links. Did you notice a little trick Amazon uses called <em>Better Together</em>. This is where they put two books together and suggest that they complement each other &#8230; and anyways - other people have bought them together; shouldn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>That in mind - and remembering that I asked about actually being in the bookstore - just notice how I noticed the truly self-medicating effect the self-help section was when I was at <a href='http://www.yelp.com/biz/borders-books-music-and-cafe-chicago-6'>Borders</a> just the other day (pictures below). Mind you, I didn&#8217;t have Amazon&#8217;s <em>Better Together</em> in mind at the time - I discovered that while writing this post - when I decided to take a few pictures of some book titles that seemed to, well, tell a story when put together.</p>

<h3 id='threesomes_its_all_in_your_head'>Threesomes. It&#8217;s all in your head.</h3>

<p>This was the one that kicked it all off. I was standing there with my <a href='http://lesfeministes.com'>wife</a> and pointed it out. She laughed and I friggin&#8217; <strong>KNEW</strong> I was on to something.</p>

<h3 id='stop_whining_i_love_you'>Stop whining. I love you.</h3>

<p>That&#8217;s a lesson one only learns after getting married.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>&#8220;Babe, why aren&#8217;t you listening to me?&#8221;</em></li>

<li><em>&#8220;Babe, why did you throw my phone out the car window?&#8221;</em></li>

<li><em>&#8220;Babe, don&#8217;t make me change my vertically striped dress shirt and plaid shorts. They match, damn it. It&#8217;s my life!&#8221;</em></li>

<li><em>&#8220;Babe, whose boxers are these?&#8221;</em> :O</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways &#8230; if you stop whining, you&#8217;ll actually see the love.</p>

<h3 id='what_happy_women_know_how_to_duck_a_suckah'>What happy women know. How to duck a suckah.</h3>

<p>Nuf said!</p>

<h3 id='hold_on_to_your_nuts_a_thousand_names_for_joy'>Hold on to your NUTs. A thousand names for Joy.</h3>

<p>The wife also laughed at this one. Oh yeah!</p>

<h3 id='the_answer_only_a_theory'>The Answer. Only a theory.</h3>

<p>I knew it! I&#8217;ve been saying that for years. I told my 5th grade teacher the same damn thing about the math test.</p>

<h2 id='moving_on'>Moving on</h2>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t figured it out, this was fun for me. I want to add more pictures and with a longer chaining of titles. We&#8217;re talking 3 or more books to create a real story of these titles.</p>
