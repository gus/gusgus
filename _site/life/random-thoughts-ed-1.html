  <div id="article" class="grid_6 omega">
    <div id="info">
      <div class="date"><cite>Aug 04, 2009</cite></div>
    </div>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m not in the mood to write anything technical. I just don&#8217;t want to. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m bored, burned out, disinterested, been-there-done-that, any of the above, none of the above. Sounds like apathy. I don&#8217;t think it is because I care about technical writing. I don&#8217;t care for silly, self-serving blog posts about how great I think I am because I wrote a piddly little gem. I don&#8217;t particularly want to sell my own brand even though the entire community of like-living individuals does that very thing.</p>

<p>I feel annoyed, anxious, frustrated, tired, or something. I feel annoyed that I don&#8217;t care about doing this. I did care about doing this. What happened? Where did it go? What is it that I really want to do? Do I want to do anything? I&#8217;m not really sure where I&#8217;m at. Am I just getting old? Did I already do everything I wanted to do? What color is my parachute? Why the fuck would I want to jump out of plane right now?</p>

<p>I think I need someone to push me and someone I can push. I have challenges all around me, but I&#8217;m not motivated to go get them. What the hell happened? I had a whole path laid out. I was really going to get shit done. I put the things I wanted to do on a spreadsheet. I did some of them. I got some others going. So &#8230; what?</p>

<p>Why am I even writing this? I guess, because it&#8217;s the one thing I feel like I need to do. Nothing else feels as important. I don&#8217;t want to do anything else right now. I don&#8217;t want to code anything. I don&#8217;t want to send any fucking emails. I don&#8217;t want to watch TV. I don&#8217;t want to play any games. Am I melting down? My brain wants to let loose of something. What the fuck is it? Come the fuck out already?</p>

<p>I want to get angry! Just let this shit out. But nothing&#8217;s coming. I just keep typing stuff. The dubstep is really appealing to me right now. I stare at this screen and &#8220;Caspa&#8221; drones on in the background with my desk and walls reverberating. Caaaaasssppppaaaa.</p>

<p>Whatever. I need some excitement I think. Something to get this body going. My mom recently hinted at some yoga/buddhist stuff. It said there are three types of people. I&#8217;m not going to bother looking this shit up for a silly post, so from memory they are: Vatta, Pita (spelling?), and Kapha. I took a test and the test scored me with 9 parts Vatta, 12 parts Pita, and 12 parts Kapha. What the hell does that even mean? I can&#8217;t even have a distinct personality type? I have to be a bunch of everything? I&#8217;m a waif that needs to be warmed up because I&#8217;m cold, but I&#8217;m also some other contradicting bullshit. And to top that off, there are counter personality types for when you&#8217;re in a phunk &#8230; but, what the shit. Which funk am I even in. I&#8217;m screwed.</p>

<p>If I wrote some code write now, I&#8217;d probably get into it, but I also know I have to get up early in the morning and when I get into coding I keep going and then I&#8217;m tired the next day and the next week and then I get sick. So &#8230; I sit. I debate with myself whether I should be productive and code. If not code, then what? I have some annoying internal drive to be productive. I have another internal drive that does not want me to be tired. I have too many drivers. I feel like I&#8217;m in drivers-ed. Someone is sitting in my passenger seat with their very own steering wheel, brake, and gas pedal. Give it back to me! Don&#8217;t even think about touching that! Where did you come from anyways? What do you want?</p>

<p>Internal conflict is a bitch. I don&#8217;t even want to edit this post, but &#8230; no, I do want to edit this post. I need to leave me alone. Maybe this is all normal. Maybe I&#8217;m normally crazy. I am cursed with indecision caused by a desire for a realistic perfection.</p>

<p>I think my brain wants to escape from all of this reality. It&#8217;s fed up and wants to me grab some surreality by the neck scruff and paint the walls with it. Splat. I think I, more than my productive counterparts whom I look upon with admiration and bewilderment, need this escape. I have two sides and they compete like crazy. I think the personality test proved that. I am no one thing. I have many sides. As much as I would like to be one for the routine simplicity of it - and at times I can be quite successful at being fruitfully, simplistically, productive with all my eggs hatching and with all my orderly ducks obeying - my biorhythms are such that I will have a proportional fall into a crest of surreality. My other half demands it. Sometimes I fall somewhere in the middle and for those brief moments I am normal?</p>

<p>I have no idea what in the hell I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

<p>Did I ever mention I&#8217;m afraid of dying. Bah &#8230; that&#8217;s an old story. Don&#8217;t really feel like talking about it. Something in me wanted to. Probably my banality.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will want to write more. However, my brain will tell me that I did my writing yesterday and sacrificed precious productive hours in order to do it. So I will tell myself I had better work. I will feel guilty for not working. But then I won&#8217;t write. Conflict ensues. I feel blah about it and do nothing due to my weakness. Indecision is my kryptonite.</p>

<p>Have I written long enough yet? Have I wasted enough time such that starting to code now will be pointless because it&#8217;s well past 11p? Have I escaped my responsibilities for the day? Will I need to do this to give myself an excuse from working without feeling bad about doing nothing on my couch?</p>

<p>Probably. Probably not.</p>

<p>The best part is I&#8217;m writing this on my fancy blog thing. This must mean I want people to read it and feel something. What do I want you to feel? I guess I want to know if you do feel and that if you do that you feel something like me or nothing like me? Maybe I&#8217;m reaching out. Groping my way into the wild to find out who gives a shit. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an attention grab. A large part of me really just wants to write this just to get out.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll probably feel like a dork for writing it and putting it out. But, I&#8217;m committing and deploying tonight so too late, you.</p>

<p>Go to bed.</p></div>
